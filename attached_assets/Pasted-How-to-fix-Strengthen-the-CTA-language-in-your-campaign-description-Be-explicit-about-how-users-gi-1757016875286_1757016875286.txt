How to fix

Strengthen the CTA language in your campaign description. Be explicit about how users give consent.
Example:

"Users opt in by creating an account on the VitalWatch app or website and explicitly checking a box that says: I agree to receive SMS notifications related to activity reminders and safety check-ins from VitalWatch. Consent is required and recorded in our database before any SMS is sent."

Show opt-in keywords clearly. In your registration form, list:

YES or START = Opt-in

STOP = Opt-out

HELP = Support

Provide screenshots or sample flow in your Twilio campaign registration:

Screenshot of signup page showing the checkbox or consent text.

Sample opt-in confirmation message (“You are now opted in to receive VitalWatch reminders and safety check-ins.”).

Adjust message samples to align with opt-in. Add a confirmation SMS sample as the first message.
Example:

"VitalWatch: You are now opted in to receive account notifications and daily check-ins. Reply STOP to unsubscribe or HELP for support."
