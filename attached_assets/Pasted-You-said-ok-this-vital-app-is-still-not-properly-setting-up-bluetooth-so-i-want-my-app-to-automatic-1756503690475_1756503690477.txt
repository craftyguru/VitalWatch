ok this vital app is still not properly setting up bluetooth so i want my app to automatically connect to my phone which its doin but then i want it to scan the pho ne for all connected bluetooth devices and then to properly display them but this ai is having problems i have a scan device but it fails to fin d my watch that i hjave connected what should i telkl this ai to to to get it to work

Got you. The most common reason your “scan” can’t see a watch that’s already connected to the phone is: you’re scanning only BLE, but the watch is BT Classic / already bonded to another app, or you’re missing Android 12+ runtime perms. Here’s exactly what to tell your AI to do, depending on stack.

If this is a native app (React Native / Kotlin / Swift)
1) Decide: BLE vs Classic

“Detect whether the target watch uses BLE (GATT) or Bluetooth Classic.

If it’s Classic-only (many older/brand-locked watches), use a Classic library (e.g. react-native-bluetooth-classic) or native BluetoothAdapter APIs.

If it’s BLE, use @dotintent/react-native-ble-plx (or react-native-ble-manager).”

2) Android permissions (SDK 31+)

“Update AndroidManifest.xml to include:”

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>


“At runtime, request BLUETOOTH_SCAN and BLUETOOTH_CONNECT (and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION on SDK ≤30). If possible, set neverForLocation in the <uses-permission-sdk-23> block for SCAN.”

“Before scanning, ensure Bluetooth is on and Location is on (Android requires it for BLE scans on many devices).”

3) iOS permissions

“Add to Info.plist: NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription and NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription. Use CBCentralManager and wait for .poweredOn before scanning. If you need background use, add proper background modes.”

4) Show already-paired devices (Classic path)

“If the watch is BT Classic and already paired, list it via BluetoothAdapter.getBondedDevices() (Android) and surface that in the UI. For React Native, expose a tiny native module or use react-native-bluetooth-classic’s getBondedDevices().”

5) Correct BLE scan flow

“Initialize BLE, then scan like this (React Native BLE PLX example):”

const manager = new BleManager();

// Ask runtime perms first (Android 12+)
await requestMultiple([
  PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.BLUETOOTH_SCAN,
  PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT,
  (Platform.Version <= 30) ? PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION : null,
].filter(Boolean) as string[]);

// Optional: Turn on location or prompt user

// Start scan with filters if you know a service UUID; else allow duplicates for a few seconds
manager.startDeviceScan(
  [/* 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' known service UUID IF you have it */],
  { allowDuplicates: false },
  async (error, device) => {
    if (error) { console.log(error); return; }
    // Heuristic: look for watch name / manufacturer data
    if (device?.name?.includes('Watch') || matchesYourAdv(device)) {
      manager.stopDeviceScan();
      try {
        const d = await device.connect({ requestMTU: 185 });
        await d.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics();
        // Cache and display services/characteristics
        const svcs = await d.services();
        // …present them in UI
      } catch (e) { console.log('connect failed', e); }
    }
  }
);

// Safety: stop scan after 10–15s
setTimeout(() => manager.stopDeviceScan(), 15000);


“If your scan returns nothing: extend scan duration to 15–30s, remove filters (temporarily), enable allowDuplicates:true, and scan again.”

6) Bonding/pairing edge cases

“If the watch is already connected to its OEM app, Android/iOS may block parallel connections. Add logic to:

detect ‘already connected elsewhere’ errors,

ask the user to disconnect it from the OEM app, then retry.”

“If pairing is required, call the OS pairing flow before connect().”

7) Display logic

“When scan completes:

Group by: Bonded (Classic), Nearby BLE, Previously seen.

For each device show: name, MAC/ID (Android), RSSI, type (BLE/Classic), bonded status.

Provide a ‘Connect’ action that runs the connect → discover → subscribe pipeline.”
