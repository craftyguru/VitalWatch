/~:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <div.cm-content cm-lineWrapping>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div. useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u> <div class=​" useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u" aria-hidden=​"true" style=​"--useView--gap:​ 4px;​ border-color:​ var(--outline-dimmer)​;​ --focusedBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​ --hoverBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​">​…​</div>​flex

/~:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <div.cm-content cm-lineWrapping>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div. useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u> <div class=​" useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u" aria-hidden=​"true" style=​"--useView--gap:​ 4px;​ border-color:​ var(--outline-dimmer)​;​ --focusedBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​ --hoverBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​">​…​</div>​flex

/~:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <div.cm-content cm-lineWrapping>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div. useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u> <div class=​" useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u" aria-hidden=​"true" style=​"--useView--gap:​ 4px;​ border-color:​ var(--outline-dimmer)​;​ --focusedBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​ --hoverBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​">​…​</div>​flex

/~:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <div.cm-content cm-lineWrapping>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div. useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u> <div class=​" useView_view__C2mnv css-16jf41b Surface_surfaceRoot__TeA2u" aria-hidden=​"true" style=​"--useView--gap:​ 4px;​ border-color:​ var(--outline-dimmer)​;​ --focusedBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​ --hoverBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​">​…​</div>​flex

eruda.js:2 Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app

eruda.js:2 Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.
